## A JavaScript frontend cross-browser compatible "PDF parser w/ template Engine" to convert pdf documents into organized data objects

A two phase process were the pdf text characters are first extracted and then processed with a template engine to turn the characters array into meaningful data objects.

### pdf parse phase

Text is extracted one character at a time while recording the coordinates (x,y) and character width. This allows you to build custom filters/reducers to extract the data you are after.

### template engine

Included template engine will extract and combine table data or values using a user provided template file that includes the coordinate bounds of the desired items.
