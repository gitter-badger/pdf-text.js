# How to contribute to pdfText.js

I'm really glad you're reading this, because I need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

The goal is to get this project posted on NPM as a simple cross-browser compatible frontend PDF parsing solution.

There is tons todo (like improving this CONTRIBUTING.md doc!)

If you would like to get involved or chat about the project, request an invite to the discord chatroom by emailing me at: <tomrule007@gmail.com>

## How to start

1. head over to the [issues board](https://github.com/tomrule007/pdf-text.js/issues) and create an issue or comment on a current one.
2. Fork the project (read more about [Fork a repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo))
3. create a branch (currently loosely following these [git name conventions](https://gist.github.com/digitaljhelms/4287848#file-gistfile1-md))

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to tomrule007/pdfText.js](https://github.com/tomrule007/pdf-text.js/pull/new/development) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## coding conventions

(anyone want to get started here? I'm currently thinking eslint w/ airbnb config needs to be added to the project but I'm open to suggestions)
